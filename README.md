# Credit-Card-Default-Prediction

Hey guys this project is about predicting whether a credit card holder is likely to fail in making timely payments, leading to a default on their credit card.

Financial institutions leverage predictive models that consider various factors, including credit history, income, debt levels, and payment behavior, to assess the creditworthiness of individuals. These models aim to identify customers at a higher risk of default, helping banks make informed decisions about extending credit and implement preventive measures to minimize potential financial losses.

So, here I am using Logistic Regression to predict whether a credit card holder is likely to fail in making timely payments in an easy understanding way within few steps.

This project id done in Colab using Python Language the below file can be directly accessed to Credit Card Default Prediction purpose.
